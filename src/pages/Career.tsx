              <ul className="list-disc pl-4 text-lg">
                <li>
                  <strong> Optimizing code for scale: </strong> Working in the
                  Sequence team, I really understood how to see the scale. When
                  writing code for the indexer I never worried about mutex
                  operations, I abused those operations, but Marcin helped me
                  realize that when we have around 7k transactions being
                  processed in each indexer, the amount of overhead such a
                  simple thing would add is a lot. After this I was always
                  really careful about writing code keeping in mind the scale.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>DB Optimization: </strong> I wrote very slow queries,
                  not caring about indexes and how Postgres plans queries which
                  is very un-intuitive. Once a query of mine on the production
                  DB was performing in 2 seconds on my local machine but 1
                  minute on the Kubernetes container in prod - after Maciej
                  debugged, he finally explained how much of a difference a HDD
                  and SSD makes - a simple line change so that Postgres uses the
                  right index and using vectors for searching, made the query
                  perform in a second. This is just one of the many instances I
                  learnt about SQL optimization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Project Layout: </strong> Sequence's Go services had a
                  very elegant project layout, it was very easy to navigate the
                  code, and to add a feature you didn't even need to know
                  anything about the codebase, you just had to know where to put
                  the code and how to write tests for it. This was a very good
                  learning experience for me, and I have tried to replicate this
                  in my personal projects.
                </li>

                  saw that the guy was as deep in tech as any of the developers,
                  familiar with all the different codebases as much as the
                  maintainers of those projects, maintaining huge libraries on
                  github, was still able to manage the company and do everything
                  basically. Similarly I saw many people there who seemed to

                  They were just so good at what they did while still being able
                  to do anything thrown at them as good as an expert. <br /> If
                  you form assumptions about what you can and can't do, you are
                  really limiting yourself which seems obvious but its really
                  difficult to not form an image of yourself in your head.
