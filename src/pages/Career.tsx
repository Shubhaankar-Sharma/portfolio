              {/* bullet point things i did */}
              <ul className="list-disc pl-4 text-xl">
                <li>
                  Worked on migrating <a href="https://sequence.info/" target="_blank">Sequence's</a> infrastructure to Kubernetes and Pulumi
                </li>
                <li>
                  Worked on shipping a highly scalable search and filtering for sequence's metadata service that indexes all Collectibles on an EVM blockchain and allows custom filtering using a collection's properties
                </li>
                <li>
                  Worked on an webhook notification system that notifies users of custom events happening on all suppoerted EVMs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintained and worked on the sequence's metadata service to make it lazily index metadata and handle around 1.5k requests per minute
                </li>
                <li>
                  Worked on <a href="https://github.com/0xsequence/ethwal/pull/9" target="_blank">ethwal's filter index</a>, this was a very elegant design thought by Marcin GÃ³rzyÅ„ski, which allowed us to store all kinds of custom events from EVMs in bitmaps and perform very complex filtering operations in them to find historical transaction data containing information we need.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </Dropdown>
            <Dropdown label="things i learnt">
              <ul className="list-disc pl-4 text-xl">
                <li>
                  Optimizing code for scale - Working in the sequence team, I really understood how to see the scale. When writing code for the indexer I never worried about mutex operations, I abused those operations, but Marcin helped me realise that when we have around 7k transactions being processed in each indexer, the amount of overhead such a simple thing would add is a lot. After this I was always really carefull about writing code keeping in mind the scale.
                </li>
                <li>
                  SQL Query Optimization - I wrote very slow queries, not caring about indexes and how postgres plans queries which is very un-intuitive, once a query of mine on the production db was performing in 2 seconds on my local machine but 1 minute on the kubernetes container in prod - after Maciej debugged, he finally explained how much of a difference a HDD and SSD makes - a simple line change so that postgres uses the right index and using vectors for searching, made the query perform in a second. This is just one of the many instances I learnt about sql optimization
                </li>
                <li>
                  Project Layout - The sequence go service's had a very elegant project layout, it was very easy to navigate the code, and to add a feature you didn't even need to know anything about the codebase, you just had to know where to put the code and how to write tests for it. This was a very good learning experience for me, and I have tried to replicate this in my personal projects.
