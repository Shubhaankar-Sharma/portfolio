Maybe open research is one way to do that. I really like this diagram by [Professor Matt Might](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) that visualizes what getting a PhD means:\n\n![The Illustrated Guide to a PhD](https://cdn.spongeboi.com/the-illustrated-guide-to-a-phd1.jpg)\n\nOutside of code, I have a deep appreciation for all forms of art and I'm really into [epistemology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/) (the theory of knowledge). I love [Nietzsche's thoughts around art](https://bigthink.com/high-culture/nietzsche-art-life/). Music-wise, I <mark>love Stratocasters</mark> and listen to everything from blues to punk rock, sufi, and lots of indie jazz fusion.\n\nRight now I'm researching probabilistic guarantees in concurrency testing and [exploring how GPU parallelism affects real-time systems](/reading/gpu-scheduling-edge-ai). I'm also really grateful to be <mark>interning at [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)</mark> where I get to work on <mark>[neki](https://neki.dev)</mark> (sharded postgres), learn from brilliant people about query planning and storage orchestration, and build fun side projects :)\n\nThings I maintain here:\n\n• <mark>[spongeboi's reading group](/reading)</mark> - a virtual shelf of interesting, fun, and some very essential essays, papers, books, websites, and blogs that I've read/found across the internet",
