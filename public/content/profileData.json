My approach is guided by \"rejecting artificial bounds\" - exceptional versatility is possible when you focus on continuous learning and building.\n\nI've been programming since I was 9, starting with QBasic. I enjoy tackling challenging, often obscure problems. I believe in contributing to communities and creating tools that help people work more effectively.\n\nCurrently doing research on real-time guarantees for edge computing.\n\nAlso :p other than this, I'm a huge cinephile and music nerd. I play guitar and the Blues - my favourite artist is John Mayer. I'm still unsure about my favourite director though (Wes Anderson seems pick me lol maybe Imtiaz Ali).",
