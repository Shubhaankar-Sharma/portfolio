    "about": "I'm passionate about building systems that solve real problems. My approach is guided by \"rejecting artificial bounds\" - a philosophy I learned from mentors who showed me that exceptional versatility is possible when you focus on continuous learning and building.\n\nFrom Arduino projects at 13 to distributed systems research at university, I enjoy tackling challenging, often obscure problems. I believe in contributing to communities and creating tools that help people work more effectively.\n\nCurrently doing research on real-time guarantees for edge computing.",
